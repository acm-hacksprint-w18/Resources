# Hack Sprint Resources - Winter 2018

## Welcome to Hack Sprint

All of us have great ideas about apps or products that we think could revolutionize the world, or make a positive impact on our community. Too often, however, these ideas are never realized because we lack the knowledge or experience to build them. Hack Sprint was created specifically to address this issue - to give you the skills, tools, and environment that will help you to build that app you've always wanted to. 

Over the next eight weeks, we'll hold four learning sessions and four hack sessions. 

The four learning sessions will take place from Week 2 - Week 5 and will cover all of the basics of Swift, Xcode, and CocoaPods. Each session will build upon the last and mentors will be available to help you whenever needed.

The four hacking sessions will take place from Week 6 - Week 9. During this time you will get together in teams and build whatever iOS you want to. Each team will be assigned one or more mentors to guide you along your development process. At the end of the quarter, you'll be able to demo your first complete iOS App!

In this repository, you'll find a guidemap to all the topics we introduce this quarter, and links to helpful resources.

We hope you have a blast this quarter, and encourage you to reach out to any of us if you have any questions or comments. Private concerns can be addressed to the current Hackschool Director, Kevin Tan, at ktan17@ucla.edu.
